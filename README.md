# YOLOv8-instance-segmentation
The YOLOv8 repository uses the same format as the YOLOv5 model: YOLOv5 PyTorch TXT. If you're looking to train YOLOv8, Roboflow is the easiest way to get your annotations in this format.

For this repository, the dataset has been downloaded from robolflow/cell_segmentation_mask
In case you want to annotate your own data, Follow https://github.com/zhong110020/labelme, data will be in XML form which needs to be converted to tex file for YOLOv8
